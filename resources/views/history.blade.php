                        Centre
                    </h3>

                    <p>Mumbai, the centre for quality medical care not only across India, but also the South Asia. A
                        city that has a rich medical history. Situated in South Mumbai is the Bombay Hospital and
                        Medical Research Centre, the medical hub of India’s biggest metropolis.
                    </p>
                    <p>Established over five decades ago, in 1952, The Bombay Hospital was the result of the enormous
                        philanthropy displayed by Shri Rameshwardas Birla, Founder Chairman of the Bombay Hospital
                        Trust. It began as a 440 bed hospital whose objective was, in its founder’s words, “to render
                        the same level of service to the poor that the rich would get in a good hospital.”</p>
                    <p>Today, the hospital has grown to house over 830 beds, some of the country’s most advanced
                        diagnostic & surgical equipment, and offers a comprehensive range of specialised medical
                        services. The objective however, remains unchanged. Which is why 33% of the patients treated are
                        in the general ward and pay only for their medicines and consumables. The free OPD at the
                        hospital successfully treats in excess of 1,00,000 patients each year.</p>
                    <p>Ever since it was established in 1952, the Bombay Hospital has instilled in its patients a sense
                        of genuine trust. Trust that has been built by combining superior medical treatment with a
                        caringly humane attitude. Which is why, in excess of two lakh people confidently walk through
                        its hallowed doors every year, year after year.</p>
