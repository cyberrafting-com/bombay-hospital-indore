                        <p>Antenatal care is handled by consultants. We have dedicated physiotherapists to advice
                            regarding antenatal exercises. For those needing special dietary considerations we have a
                            dietician also available.</p>

                        <p>We have an excellent labour ward with staff who offer tender, loving care. The doctors are
                            present at all times, so emergencies are handled effectively. There is facility for epidural
                            analgesia for those keen on having painless labour. We have a state of the art CTG or NST
                            which helps us in monitoring the babies before and during labour. We have a high vaginal
                            delivery rate for uncomplicated cases. However if and when a caesarean is needed we have an
                            excellent OT with competent doctors and assistants. Even the decision to do a caesarean is
                            taken only in consultation with the mother and her partner.</p>

                        <p>All deliveries are attended by a neonatologist, ensuring that the baby receives good care
                            from the start itself. The NICU facility is excellent, this enables us to manage high risk
                            cases very nicely. Even very premature babies have an excellent survival rate.For high risk
                            cases and pregnancies we have the facilities of ICU, Physicians, Intensivists and
                            Nephrologists as and when required. Again this helps us to have a Multi disciplinary
                            approach and reduce the risk and rate of complications that a mother faces. Even when a
                            complication arises it is managed very effectively. There is a fully equipped 24 hours blood
                            bank and laboratory. This also helps in the prompt investigation and starting of treatment.
                            Post delivery the mother is looked after in well equipped wards. Breast feeding is started
                            right after delivery on the delivery table itself and motivated till 6 months exclusively.
