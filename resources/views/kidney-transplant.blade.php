                        <p>With advances in kidney transplant methods and improvement in transplant success rate, a
                            kidney transplant is now widely considered to be the best way of treating chronic kidney
                            disease for many people. A transplant may offer the best chance of returning to a more
                            normal life. Bombay Hospital Indore has a team of world class Urologists and Nephrologists
                            and state-of-the art Operation Theatres, Recovery Rooms and equipments for performing
                            Kindney Transplants. Bombay Hospital Indore is performing Kidney Transplant Surgeries since
                            August 2011 with success rate at par with all international centers.
                        </p>
                        <p>A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure performed to implant a healthy kidney from
                            another person in a patient of chronic kidney disease. The kidney may come from a deceased
                            organ donor or from a living donor. Family members with a good match may be able to donate
                            one of their kidneys. This type of transplant is called a living transplant. Individuals who
                            donate a kidney can live healthy lives with the remaining kidney.</p>

                        <p>A person receiving a transplant usually receives only one kidney, but, in rare situations, he
                            or she may receive two kidneys from a deceased donor. In most cases, the diseased kidneys
                            are left in place during the transplant procedure. The transplanted kidney is implanted in
                            the lower abdomen on the front side of the body.</p>

                        <p>To prevent kidney rejection from the body, patient requires medications to suppress the
                            immune system. Patients have to take these drugs for the rest of his/her life. Medications
                            suppress immune system, makes the patient more vulnerable to get infections, Patient may
                            also need antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal medications.</p>
