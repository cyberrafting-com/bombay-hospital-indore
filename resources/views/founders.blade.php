                            was born in Bombay on the 4th July, 1918. Shri M. P. Babu, as he was universally and
                            affectionately known, was a man of great enterprise, who set up a host of companies
                            like Birla Corp, Universal Cables, Vindhya Telelinks, Hindustan Gum & Chemicals,
                            Digvijay Woollen Mills, Indian Smelting, etc., all leaders in their own fields,
                            manufacturing quality products. He also established Birla Planetorium & Belle Vue
                            Clinic and several schools in Calcutta.
                        </p>

                        <p>Shri M. P. Babu will be remembered as a great philanthropist rather than as a leading
                            and eminent industrialist. Totally devoid of ego, and instinctively averse to
                            self-advertisement, he gave profusely and generously to charitable causes spread
                            over the length and breadth of the country, without ever expecting or allowing his
                            name to be associated with his munificent donations. He established the M. P. Birla
                            Foundation in fulfilment of his deep commitment to furthering progress in the fields
                            of education and medicine. Shri M. P. Birla was also intimately associated with the
                            famous Birla Institute of Technology & Science at Pilani.</p>

                        <p>Bombay Hospital enjoyed a very special place in his heart. He liberally gave crores of rupees
                            to this great Institution. He took keen interest in the working of the Hospital and made
                            frequent enquiries about the quality of treatment, more particularly to the poor and needy.
                            He was responsible in no small measure, for the growth and development of the Hospital, set
                            up by his illustrious father Shri Rameshwardasji Birla, into a 750 bedded Hospital, one of
                            the largest and best equipped in the country.</p>

                        <p>In private life he was shy and self-effacing and a man of simple habits with few needs, a man
                            who earned in order to spend it for worthy causes. Indeed, he imbibed the great message of
                            the Upanishads that wealth should be enjoyed by giving it generously.</p>

                        <p>Shri M. P. Babu breathed his last on 30th July, 1990 at Calcutta. With his demise the nation
                            has lost an eminent industrialist a great philanthropist, and above all, a good human being.

                        <p class="mb-30">Born on 3rd November, 1908, in the well-known public spirited Zamindar family
                            of Najidabad in U.P., known as the Sahu Jain family, Babuji, as he was affectionately
                            addressed, had in his youth, the advantage of seeing in operation, and coming in contact
                            with, the cultural ethos of the period, where Hindus, Muslims, Jains and other communities,
                            had evolved a pattern of living in amity, and peacefully following the practices of their
                            respective religions and social codes. It was this blend of cultural actions and reactions,
                            that had gone into the mental make-up of Babuji, resulting in the formation of an integrated
                            Indian personality, steadfast in the inherited cultural values and adept at adjustment with
                            best that was progressive and modern.

                        <p>Babuji’s passion for social, civic and educational activities, became manifest at an early
                            stage of his life, during which he founded numerous schools, colleges, dispensaries and
                            charitable institutions, to foster education, and provide medical relief to the poor and the
                            needy. He was a multi-facetted personality, covering diverse fields like education,
                            industry, social welfare and religion. He was a Member of the First Rajya Sabha from Bombay,
                            for six years 1952 – 1958, and was one of the most widely respected industrialist in the
                            country, whose advice and guidance was regularly sought on all matters concerning industry

                        <p>He was the leader of the Jain Community and in recognition of his services to the community,
                            he was honoured with the titles of ”SHRIYANS ABHINAV” and ”SAMAJ SHIROMANI” and was also
                            awarded the ”TAMRA PATRA” for his devotion and continued service, not only to Jains but to
                            the public at large. He was conferred title of ”SHRAVAK SHIROMANI”, the highest title the
                            community can offer to its leaders, in recognition of his services to the Jain community. In
                            1988, Babuji was decorated with the prestigious award of Padma Bhushan, for his manifold
                            services to society.</p>

                        <p>He was a Trustee of the Bombay Hospital Trust, ever since its inception, and on the demise of
                            the founder Chairman, Shri Rameshwardasji Birla in 1973, the mantle of Chairmanship of the
                            Bombay Hospital Trust, fell on his capable shoulders. He built on the edifice raised by Shri
                            Rameshwardasji Birla, and was in no small measures, responsible for the Hospital becoming
                            one of the premier medical institution in the country. In his association with the affairs
                            of the Hospital, he brought to bear his usual thoroughness and passion for detail. There was
                            no aspect of the running of the Hospital that he was not conversant with, and amazed
                            everyone as to how, inspite of his multifarious and diverse activities, compounded by his
                            delicate health, he still found the time and the energy, to go deep into matters concerning
                            the Hospital. He was always willing to lend a patient ear to doctors, officials and others
                            connected with the Hospital, who came to him for advice and guidance, and endeared himself
                            to everyone who came in contact with him, with his humility, gentleness and innate goodness.
                            The demise of Shri Shriyansprasadji is indeed an irreparable loss, not only to his family
                            but also to his friends, admirers and the business community. The country has lost a great
                            and good man. The Bombay Hospital Trust will miss his wise counsel and guidance.</p>
