                        <p>Before a treatment or rehabilitation protocol can be established, your orthopaedist must
                            first determine the reason for, and source of, your condition. This typically involves a
                            comprehensive physical examination and a detailed medical history profile, in addition to a
                            complete history and description of the symptoms related to your condition. During this
                            initial gathering of information, be sure to notify your doctor of any other illnesses,
                            injuries, or complaints that have been associated with the pain or condition, as well as any
                            previous treatments or medications prescribed. Preliminary diagnostic tests may then follow,
                            including blood tests and/or X-rays.</p>

                                and structures within the body; can often determine damage or disease in a surrounding

                                horizontal, or axial, images (often called slices) of the body. A CT scan shows detailed
                                images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans
                                are more detailed than general X-rays.</p>
