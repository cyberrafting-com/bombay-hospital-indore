                        <p><b>Frozen Sections :</b>In cases where preoperative diagnosis of any lesion is not confirmed,
                            during surgery while the patient still in operation theatre; a piece from suspicious area is
                            taken and sent to the laboratory. A diagnosis is made available in about 1‚ÅÑ2 hour that helps
                            in planning the extent of surgery and further line of treatment. Requires special expertise,
                            training and equipment.</p>
