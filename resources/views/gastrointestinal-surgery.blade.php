                        <p>Frequently, complete surgical resection remains the only chance of cure in patients with HPB
                            malignancies. However, these cancers are commonly deemed unresectable due to involvement of
                            major vasculature. Utilizing surgical techniques from transplantation, our surgeons are
                            experienced in performing complex vascular resections and reconstructions for otherwise
